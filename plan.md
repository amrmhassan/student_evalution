1. what is the scope of messaging search(how any user will start a chat)
    - will the student be able to chat with another student or only with his teachers
    - will the teacher be able to chat with other students that aren't his

Some Notes
1. Calling part in messages won't be done in the traditional way, it will need a custom server other than Firebase
